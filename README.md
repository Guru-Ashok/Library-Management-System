# 📚 Library Management System

## 📝 Description
The **Library Management System** is a console-based Java application designed to manage the operations of a library efficiently.  
It allows the librarian to **add new books**, **register members**, **issue books** to members, and **return books** when they are submitted.

The system keeps track of which books are **available** and which are **issued**, along with the member information.  
It demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **classes**, **objects**, **encapsulation**, and **data handling** in Java.
